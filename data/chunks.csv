Subject: Bioelectronic Diagnostics Patent Available (George Washington University)

Hello,

I am a Research Fellow in George Washington University’s Technology
Commercialization Office. Our patent in neuromorphic bioelectronic systems could
provide your company, Company Name, with a competitive edge.

Researchers at George Washington University have developed a novel implantable
system that enables real-time bioelectric signal monitoring, interpretation, and
therapeutic response using a compact network of computing chiplets. Leveraging
memristor-based architecture and artificial neural networks, this technology eliminates
the need for bulky external processors and leads, offering a low-power, efficient, and
scalable solution for high-definition diagnostics and therapy.

Below is the link to the technology and patent number:

Memristors and neuromorphic networks for high definition bioelectric diagnostics and
therapy

Patent Number:  

Are you available for a brief call to discuss our technology? Our Senior Licensing
Manager, Michael Harpen, would be happy to speak with you.

Best regards,"
