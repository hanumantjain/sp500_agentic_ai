Market Cap. (GBP £ M): 818.5
*Target Price is for 12 months. mg Mixed 1H15: While Shawbrook reported lower-than-expected mortgage growth for
the first half of the year, industry-wide growth rates were also down. However, the

m Financial Guidance: The Company recently reaffirmed its long-term and short-term
Billy Valentine financial guidance, including £2 billion in gross originations by FY 17, NIM remaining

stable at current levels, a Cost-to-Income Ratio of 40% by FY 17, a pre-tax ROA of

3.5% by FY 17, annualised cost of risk of 0.5-0.6%, and a CET 1 Ratio of at least 13%.

We believe the Gross Origination and NIM targets may be on the high side, given

Price Performance Since IPO market headwinds and increased competition. However, Shawbrook’s relatively

bas diversified loan book (only “22% BTL mortgages vs. 41% for ALD and 46% for OSB)
& 300p may help it weather the storm of regulatory changes.
