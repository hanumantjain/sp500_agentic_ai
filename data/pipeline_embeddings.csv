Shawbrook Grou p PLC (LSE: SHAW)

Price (18 Sep 15, GBp):

Target Price (GBp): Modest Upside for Next 12 Months; Possible
S2-WeekPrice Ratige: 301p—381p ~~ Economic Headwinds Ahead
Market Cap. (GBP £ M): 818.5
*Target Price is for 12 months. mg Mixed 1H15: While Shawbrook reported lower-than-expected mortgage growth for
the first half of the year, industry-wide growth rates were also down. However, the
Research Analysts: company’s NIM remained stable, its Cost-to-Income Ratio fell to 48.9%, and its CET 1
Donnie Azoff, CFA Ratio rose to 15.2% as a result of the successful IPO in April.

Mark Hanna, CFA

m Financial Guidance: The Company recently reaffirmed its long-term and short-term
Billy Valentine financial guidance, including £2 billion in gross originations by FY 17, NIM remaining

stable at current levels, a Cost-to-Income Ratio of 40% by FY 17, a pre-tax ROA of

3.5% by FY 17, annualised cost of risk of 0.5-0.6%, and a CET 1 Ratio of at least 13%.

We believe the Gross Origination and NIM targets may be on the high side, given

Price Performance Since IPO market headwinds and increased competition. However, Shawbrook’s relatively

bas diversified loan book (only “22% BTL mortgages vs. 41% for ALD and 46% for OSB)
& 300p may help it weather the storm of regulatory changes.
